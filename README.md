# Road to NODES 2023: Neo4j Graph Data Science with Generative AI
This repo contains additional materials related to the Road to NODES 2023: Neo4j Graph Data Science with Generative AI workshop.

## Presentation Video
The presentation video [is available here](https://www.youtube.com/live/SUhM5SOYcd4?feature=shared) on the Neo4j YouTube page. A [summary of the transcript](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/NODES2023_GDS_GenAI/blob/main/nodes2023_GDS_GenAI_SUMMARY.txt) is also published in this repository.

## Presentation Slides
A [PDF of our presentation slides](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/NODES2023_GDS_GenAI/blob/main/NODES_2023_GDS_GenAI.pdf) is saved in this repository.

## Agent Neo Public Code Repo
A public version of the Agent Neo code is availble [in this repository](https://github.com/a-s-g93/agent-neo-public).

## Building LLM Applications Grounded on a Neo4j Knowledge Graph
For a detailed walkthrough about building a similar LLM application grounded on a knowledge graph, we highly recommend [this article](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/building-educational-chatbot-neo4j/) by our colleague Adam Cowley. The public code associated with the article is published [in this repository](https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/learning-assistant).

## LLM Analysis Notebook
A detailed Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of grounding documentation and LLM conversations is published [in this repository](https://github.com/danb-neo4j/NODES2023_GDS_GenAI/blob/main/NODES2023_GenAI_GDS_Analysis.ipynb). Note that this notebook is not designed to be copied and run as-is, but rather is intended to outline a workflow and provide starter code for your analysis. The notebook also demonstrates using different versions of Google's PaLM-2 LLMs (Text-Bison, Chat-Bison, Code-Bison, and CodeChat-Bison) throughout the workflow. 

## Blogs
Throughout this project we have published multiple blogs about grounding LLM applications in knowledge graphs and the importance of high-quality grounding data sets. The following blogs are available:
